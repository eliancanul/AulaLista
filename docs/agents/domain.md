# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`GLOSSARY.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`GLOSSARY-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists — it points at one `GLOSSARY.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

`CONTEXT.md` remains a historical reference during the transition. Until `GLOSSARY.md` exists, use its established vocabulary and authority boundaries. A glossary update does not silently supersede an accepted ADR.

## File structure

Single-context repo (the current layout):

```text
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-example-decision.md
│   └── 0002-example-decision.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, or a test name), use the term as defined in `GLOSSARY.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

Keep `GLOSSARY.md` limited to concise domain definitions and avoided synonyms. Implementation rules, equations, test plans and evidence belong in their own documents; record an ADR only for a hard-to-reverse, surprising decision with a real trade-off.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 — but worth reopening because…_
